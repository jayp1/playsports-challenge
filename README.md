# GCN Responsiveness Challenge (mobile only)

The task of this project was to recreate and improve the navigation user experience of the GCN home page for mobile users. I completed this task using the React javascript framework.

### The following improvements were made:
- Set the positioning of the top navigation bar to 'fixed' so that the user has access to the navigation items at all times.
- Added a menu sidedrawer with the navigation links to only appear when requested by the user.
- Reduced the number of navigation links.
- Reduced the number of videos returned.

### Further possible improvements include:
- Add an additional navigation layer for the top level items.
- Remove the background color for active social links.

## Requirements

Node.js 8+

## Setup

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/jayp1/playsports-challenge.git
```

2. Navigate to the root directory and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
